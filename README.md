# Final Project: Predicting Trip Times & Final Destinations of Taxi Trips in Porto, Portugal
## General Assembly Part-Time Data Science Course
## Completed November 5, 2016

### Overview
This project is based off of two Kaggle competitions ([I](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pkdd-15-predict-taxi-service-trajectory-i) and [II](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pkdd-15-taxi-trip-time-prediction-ii/data)) from 2015 that were posted by ECML PKDD* and completed by conference attendees.

The competition was a demonstration on how to make electronic dispatching systems more efficient by predicting the earliest time in which a driver can accept a new passenger based upon the location of the final destination and a prediction on how long the trip should take.

The Kaggle/ conference competitions had two immediate aims:
1. Predict the final destination of a taxi ride in Porto, Portugal based upon a partial trajectory of the beginning of the ride.
2. Predict the duration of the ride.

### Final Project Objectives
For my final project, I chose to predict the final destination and trip time of a randomly selected partial trajectory (trip #40).
